Hello! Iâ€™m a product designer residing in Chicago. I like taking complicated problems and breaking them into small steps toward a solution through design and code. Currently, I practice this at [Iridescent](http://iridescentlearning.org/), a 501c3 nonprofit focusing on underserved communities.

I also enjoy making things outside of work, such as podcasts, drawings, games and sometimes even [tables](https://www.instagram.com/p/BMg00XdhOz9/). I live with my cat named Pye and I ride a shiny bike with a shiny helmet. You can find me elsewhere on the internet below:

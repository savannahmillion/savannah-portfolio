            <strong>A web application that hosts STEM projects kids can engineer and connects them with professional mentors to help them learn.</strong> Iridescent hired me in 2015 to work full time on Curiosity Machine as a designer and developer. Since then, I've focused both on improving the existing interface and adding new features.

            This project is ongoing and spans a long period of time. I'm still working on this case study! Please check back soon.
